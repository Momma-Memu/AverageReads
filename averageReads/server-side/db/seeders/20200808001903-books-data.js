{"id":19,"author":"Alice A. Bailey","rating":"4.16","description":"Many translations have been made from the original Sanskrit of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. They have become well loved, well used, and well applied by many in all parts of the world and of all religious beliefs. The Sutras have a power and a timelessness about them which demonstrate the accuracy with which they pinpoint the basic truths of human evolution from subservience to personality clamours to the serene freedom of the soul. Most human problems today originate in selfish desire; the prostitution of the feeling nature to self-centred physical appetites. This is also brought out clearly in the teaching of the Lord Buddha, the treading of the Noble Eight-Fold path providing the only way out of the maze: \"Right Values; Right Speech; Right Mode of Living; Right Thinking; Right Expression; Right Conduct; Right Effort; Right Rapture or True Happiness\". These are attributes of the soul. Patanjali explores exhaustively the means, the techniques and the mental posture which create the connecting thread between the form-centred personality and these stages towards spiritual achievement and soul fusion. The four parts of the book develop: 1. The Problem of Union (51 sutras). 2. The Steps to Union (55 sutras). 3. Union Achieved and Its Results (55 sutras). 4. Illumination (34 sutras). Many different training techniques have been available over the centuries, depending on the condition of human consciousness and the phase of spiritual growth to be accomplished. Each \"Yoga\" has had its place, fulfilled its function, and become an absorbed part of human experience. In this book the factor of mind in meeting present-day needs is again given prominence as the agent of the soul, and the key to personality release. These Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are based on Raja Yoga, the \"kingly science of the soul\": \"Through the science of Raja Yoga the mind will be known as the instrument of the soul and the means whereby the brain of the aspirant becomes illuminated and knowledge gained of those matters which concern the realm of the soul.\" The soul is concerned with the working out of planetary purpose and plan; so again we find that mental training, and the self-achievement of the individual, lead to cooperation and service on a scale far more comprehensive and of far greater evolutionary significance than merely the individual effects on the life of the disciple. Sutra 31 of Part IV rings out like a bell and a clarion call to those who venture on the path of union with the soul. \"When through the removal of hindrances and the purification of the sheaths, the totality of knowledge becomes available, naught further remains for the man to do.\"","published":"1927-12-01T06:00:00.000Z","publisher":"Lucis Publishing Company","image":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356469644l/139354._SX98_.jpg","title":"The Light of the Soul: Its Science and Effect: A Paraphrase of the Yoga Sutras of Pata~njali","createdAt":"2020-09-06T04:45:19.574Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T04:45:19.574Z"},

With wonderful eloquence, Keegan illuminates Churchill's incredible strength during this crucial moment in history and his unshakable belief that democracy would always prevail. Keegan looks at Churchill's speeches, which are some of the greatest examples of English oratory, and identifies his ability to communicate his own idea of an English past as the source of Churchill's greatness. He also sheds light on the political climate of Churchill's time. The result is an insightful, sensitive portrait of Churchill the war leader and Churchill the man.","published":"2002-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","publisher":"Viking Books","image":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1391887602l/37828._SX98_.jpg","title":"Winston Churchill","createdAt":"2020-09-06T05:41:16.481Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T05:41:16.481Z"},

{"id":94,"author":"Carol Field","rating":"4.26","description":"Bread in Italy is rough country loaves with thick chewy crusts and flat disks of focaccia seasoned with the wild herbs of the fields. It is celebratory sweet holiday breads dense with fat raisins, toasted nuts and candied fruit peels. It is \"new wave\" wave\" breads, recently invented by artisan bakers and studded with roasted peppers, sun. dried tomatoes and salty olive paste. It is imaginative multi-grain breads and rolls with tastes and shapes that vary dramatically from region to region.Recipes for the breads of all these regions, for the comforting rustic soups and salads and appetizers based on them, for breadsticks and rolls, pizza and focaccia, for holiday specialties, for pastries, cookies, cornetti and nut tortes, fruit tarts, cheesecakes and spice cakes and other confections-all are offered in this landmark volume which presents, for the first time in English or Italian, the diverse baking traditions of Italy.Knowing these regional specialties and the stories behind them is like taking a trip through the Italian countryside. Putting the recipes on paper as Carol Field has done is like preserving the villages in the Italian hillsides with their churches and frescoes, for they are part of a tradition that has never before been recorded. In preparing for this book, Carol Field spent two years working with the bakers of Italy, traversing the country again and again from Lugano and Como in the north to Lecce and Palermo in the south, tasting and testing, then going back to the States to rework the recipes in an American kitchen with American ingredients. The result is recipes that are impeccably written for utmost ease and flexibility. Some are simple and earthy, some elegant and refined, but all will be a revelation to Americans who have previously known Italian breads and desserts only from the limited and stereotyped range available until now. Each recipe offers instructions for making doughs by hand, by electric mixer, and by food processor. Illustrations provide clear step-by-step how-to, and chapters on ingredients, equipment and technique reveal all the whys and wherefores.","published":"1995-09-01T05:00:00.000Z","publisher":"William Morrow Cookbooks","image":"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1407110665l/39272._SX98_.jpg","title":"The Italian Baker","createdAt":"2020-09-06T05:31:30.442Z","updatedAt":"2020-09-06T05:31:30.442Z"},
